## Course Description
Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces. Students will learn and practice how to design, realize, and evaluate visual analytics methods integrating interactive visualization, statistical analysis methods, machine learning, and high-performance computing techniques for solving complex data analysis problems found in real-world applications. The class is formatted as  a research seminar. Each week, students will read papers and present the papers in class for discussion. There will be one final project consisting of tasks including literature study, writing and presenting the project proposal, creating a software implementation to demonstrate a visual analytics design for data-driven problem solving or decision making, writing a project report, and presenting the project to the instructor and other students.
